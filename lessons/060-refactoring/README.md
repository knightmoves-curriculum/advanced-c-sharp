In today's lesson we'll look at refactoring code. Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior, with the goal of improving its internal structure, readability, and maintainability. Test automation must be in place in order to refactor because it validates that the external functionality remains unchanged while the internal structure is being modified. Developers should refactor regularly because it reduces technical debt, makes code easier to understand and extend, and helps prevent bugs in the long run.

``` cs

```

`dotnet test`

In the coding exercise you will refactor your code.

## Main Points
- Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior, with the goal of improving its internal structure, readability, and maintainability.


## Suggested Coding Exercise
- Have students refactor their code.

## Building toward CSTA Standards:
- Develop and use a series of test cases to verify that a program performs according to its design specifications (3B-AP-21) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
