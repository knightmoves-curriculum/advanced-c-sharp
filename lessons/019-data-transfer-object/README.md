In today's lesson we'll learn about data transfer objects.  A Data Transfer Object (DTO) is a simple object that carries data between processes. DTOs are typically used to encapsulate data and send it from one subsystem of an application to another. DTOs are used to deserialize API payloads to ensure that the data structure matches the API contract, reducing coupling between different layers of an application and promoting cleaner code. By using DTOs, you can avoid directly exposing your domain entities, which helps maintain separation of concerns and simplifies validation and transformation of data.
