In today's lesson we will add a weather forecast.  Up until now we've listed randomly generated weather forecasts through the HTTP Get Method.
HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a way for web browsers and servers to talk to each other, allowing you to request and view websites and other online content.
HTTP has several ways to interact with a web applicaiton.  One of these ways is through a GET request.  A GET request in HTTP is used to ask an application server for data without making any changes to it. 
When you make a GET request, like the one you've seen with the WeatherForecast, you're simply asking the server to send back information in a format like JSON. 
This is the most common way to retrieve data from a server in web applications.

In this lesson we will introduce a second HTTP Method called POST.  A POST request in HTTP is used to send data to a server to create a new resource, in our case this is a weather forecast. 
When you make a POST request, you're providing information about a weather forecast which the server processes and stores as a new entry. 
Unlike a GET request, which only retrieves data, a POST request specifically adds new weather forecast information to the application server.
