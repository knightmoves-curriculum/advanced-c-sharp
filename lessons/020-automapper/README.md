In today's lesson we'll pull the mapping logic out of the controller in order to satisfy the single responsibility principle.  While we pull this code out we will simplify the mapping prossess by using Automatpper to map our DTO to entities.  AutoMapper is a small library that significantly reduces the code needed to map one object to another.
